## About Astralis-7

Astralis-7, a tidally locked exoplanet orbiting a K-type star at 0.4 AU, is a world of extremes. Its day side is scorched by relentless heat, while its night side is plunged into eternal darkness. But within the habitable zone, between these two extremes, there lies a possibility for life to thrive.

### Planetary System
Astralis-7's near-zero eccentricity allows for constant tidal forces, resulting in tidal locking. Its iron-rich core generates a strong magnetic field, shielding it from harmful solar radiation. The planet's atmosphere, composed of nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water vapor, plays a crucial role in sustaining life.

### Living on Astralis-7
Life on Astralis-7 has adapted uniquely to its extreme conditions. Organisms on the day side have evolved strategies to cope with continuous sunlight, including migration, hibernation, and specialized adaptations. On the night side, bioluminescence is prevalent, aiding in navigation and communication in perpetual darkness. Enhanced sensory systems and temperature resistance mechanisms have evolved, making Astralis-7 a fascinating tapestry of adaptability.
